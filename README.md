# Dotfiles
- Curl
- Stow
- Git
- Fish
- Starship
- Tmux
- Docker (not actually a part of the dotfiles, I just want it automatically
install with my dotfiles because I'm cool like that :)

### Setup
Run this I dare you:
```sh
which curl &> /dev/null \
    && curl -L https://github.com/cyrus01337/dotfiles-but-better/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash \
    || wget -qO - https://github.com/cyrus01337/dotfiles-but-better/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Author's Note
If you run this, you are based and cool. :)
